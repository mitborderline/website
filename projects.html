      <p>"Tunnels connect many of MIT's buildings, and they can even connect a community in quarantine. Inspired by
        Corona Maison, Tunnel66 is a place to gather and showcase the unique cultures of the MIT and adMIT communities,
        in lieu of CPW. Each person adds a room to Tunnel66, forming one connected tunnel below."
      <p>

      <p>This is the philosophy behind <a href="http://tunnel.mit.edu/" target="tunnel">Tunnel66</a>, Borderline's
        Spring 2020 project which strives to deliver the magic of the Borderline murals-- a living, breathing
        collaborative work of art where the MIT community can express themselves and share with others-- to wherever we
        may be scattered. It's an opportunity to gather and showcase what makes our campus, and our community, so
        special. As an exciting update, Tunnel66 was featured on <a

                        Borderline is a club at MIT that started in Spring of 2017 (our freshman spring), when a group
                        of upperclassmen got funding from the Council of the Arts at MIT to paint a 200-foot long
                        section of the MIT Tunnels under building 66. Then, augmented reality animations were added to
                        some of the murals, meaning if you put your phone up to the murals, an animation will play over
                        it! That semester, we both got to make our own murals and animations, and since then, we have
                        been part of the exec team as co-AR chairs, teaching anyone who wants to learn, how to make
                        their own AR animations! Borderline has really expanded past the tunnels through a variety of
                        projects, and is now a community of people interested in the intersection of art and technology.
                        CPW is something we, as a club, were really looking forward to as a time to showcase to the
                        incoming class what Borderline is all about: collaboration and community through art and
                        technology! So as part of this years CP*, Borderline has launched a “digital tunnel,” Tunnel66,
                        to stay connected!<br><br>psssttt @ 2024 pre-frosh: download the <a
                          href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/artivive/id1188737494" target="vive">Artivive</a> app to
                        find some secret AR messages on the tunnel66 murals :D :A</p>

                      <p><b class="people">Gloria ’21, President:</b><br>
                        I remember being interested in Borderline ever since seeing the club’s AR demo at CPW Midway,
                        even before I knew I was coming to MIT. Freshman fall, I painted and animated a mural in the
                        tunnel. The following spring, I painted another mural in the Banana Lounge and joined Borderline
                        exec. I’m now President of the club during one of the weirdest semesters in recent memory. Like
                        many other clubs, Borderline was planning and looking forward to events and projects (including
                        CPW) this semester– then we got sent home. </p>
                      <p>About a month into Corona-tine, our Pub Chair, Sky, suggested that Borderline do a
                        collaborative art project to connect the community in isolation, and she shared this project.
                        Around the same time, we started getting CP(*) planning emails from ASA, and the idea of
                        Tunnel66 was born. After some more planning, I wrote up the Tunnel66 site, requested the
                        tunnel.mit.edu hostname, and drew the first “room” in a couple days. Since CPW was probably the
                        reason I comMITted, I’m excited to contribute to a project that preserves some of that energy
                        for this year’s adMITs and encapsulates the magic of Borderline’s murals– a living, breathing
                        collaborative work of art where students can express themselves and share with the community.

                        When I first saw the Borderline murals in the tunnels on my campus tour as a rising high school
                        senior, I didn’t know what it was called, but I knew I just had to come back and walk through
                        the tunnels once more after the actual tour had concluded. To me, it radiated colors and
                        inspiring energy of so many kinds, in so many aspects; I could only imagine how many more have
                        smiled and gazed at those murals, and walked away with thoughts and imaginations. I have wished
                        that I could contribute to this massive, collaborative masterpiece all up until I got to paint a
                        mural and join Borderline’s exec board in my first semester at MIT, which I’m beyond grateful
                        for. </p>
                      <p>Since then, working behind the magic of those amazing murals with a team of dedicated
                        art-lovers have definitely broadened my understanding of different communities and art styles.
                        While unfortunately our original plans for CPW and the semester have been halted, the idea of
                        Tunnel66 sounded to me just as inspiring and welcoming as a way to showcase aspects of MIT
                        communities – and this time, even prefrosh could join! I drew up a very simple template with a
                        ladder that connects each room in the tower, coz although we are all physically apart, we still
                        want to be together in spirit! I can’t wait to see this tower built collaboratively by members
                        of the MIT community & adMITs and learn more about what everyone else’s been up to!</p>

                      <p><b class="people">Jenny ’22, Animation Co-chair:</b><br>
                        When I was a junior in high school, my Science Olympiad team came to MIT to participate in the
                        invitational that MIT hosts every year. While I was running from event to event, trying to
                        figure out where I’m supposed to be next, I accidentally wandered into the basement and got
                        outrageously lost, but somehow ended up in the tunnels in building 66. I didn’t even know it was
                        AR or animation related, but the murals were stunning. I couldn’t stay for long, but I knew I
                        definitely wanted to come back one day and contribute some way or another to the organization
                        behind it. Freshman year, I got to take a better look at it and realized the murals were
                        animated!! I had never really drawn or painted, but I started learning Blender (a 3D modeling
                        program) to try my hand at digital animation. I was able to join Borderline exec my sophomore
                        fall, and I’m so grateful for this opportunity to make art more accessible to others, and to
                        bring a splash of color and joy to MIT students who often walk through the tunnels to get around
                        campus. Tunnel66 is an interactive, community building project that brings together all of
                        Borderline’s unique strengths, combining AR, art, and a sense of community to all.</p>

                        The week before orientation my freshman fall was the first time I saw the tunnels under building
                        66, and the moment I saw the first animation I knew I had to get involved with Borderline.
                        Having never been very good at drawing, being an artist always seemed like an unattainable task
                        to me, but animation has helped me bridge the gap between art and technology. I’m hoping to
                        continue to promote art across MIT’s campus!</p>

      <p>Over MIT’s Independent Activities Period (IAP) in January 2019, over a dozen MIT students and just as many
        women inmates worked together for three hours a day on a two-story mural in the South Bay House of Correction.
        The project and class were led by Sara Brown, MIT Assistant Professor and Director of Design for MIT Music and
        Theater Arts, and Peggy Rambach, arts teacher at South Bay. A replica of the mural has been displayed on campus
        in the MIT List Visual Arts Center.
      </p>
      <p>During the first part of the project participants practiced key painting techniques and reflected on images
        with the greatest symbolism in their own lives, eventually agreeing on a core set of visuals including a mother
        lovingly cradling her child, a sunset radiating through an open door, and water droplets descending from an eye
        in the sky. After learning and practicing a wide range of painting and composition techniques, participants
        split the two-story mural into nine panels and collaborated to combine them into one cohesive work. Although the
        class and project themselves have ended, the parallel murals exhibited at the South Bay House of Correction and
        at MIT serve as a reminder that the lessons learned, memories created, and friendships formed will remain intact
        for far longer.

      <p>As part of the College of Computing Opening, Borderline helped organize The Mural Augmentation Challenge! This
        was an opportunity for MIT students to add their own Augmented Reality animations to the Stata Street murals
        made by ten MIT students in December 2018. As part of the challenge, Borderline held an AR workshop in the Stata
        Center to teach students one-on-one how to make their AR animations from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>In parallel to the Mural Augmentation Challenge, a ten foot printed copy of the mural painted in the Suffolk
        County House of Correction was also hung in the Stata Center for the College of Computing Opening. This project
        was a collaborative effort between Sara Brown, Senior Lecturer for MTA, MIT students in her IAP class, the ESG
        Prison Initiative, and the female inmates at the prison.</p>

      <p class="italic"><b>Some Thoughts From Brazil:</b></p>
      <p><b>Jierui-</b> &nbsp;Arriving in Brazil, I was surprised at how colorful, modern, and geometric all the
        buildings were.
        I was also surprised to learn that it was winter in São Paulo. Despite the jet lag, I loved listening as
        filmmaker Alessandra Emy and graffiti artist V taught about the unique Brazilian pixo style, that originated
        right here in São Paulo.</p>

      <p><b>Julia-</b> &nbsp;São Paulo definitely has character. Graffiti and public sculptures were everywhere, and
        old buildings
        were squashed between new modern architecture, but even the new buildings had pichacao (tagging) on them. The
        streets were strangely quiet and open because we had arrived in the middle of a fuel strike. Strikers, mainly
        truckers, angry at the increase in gas price, were blocking the roads into the city, preventing gasoline, but
        also inadvertently groceries and other materials, from entering the city. Such a strike has never happened
        before, and everyone was worried, but the city continued to function, and we got to experience a very lively
        metropolitan. </p>

      </div>
      <p>We got to work with a different set of street artists everyday, which was both a logistical nightmare, but also
        extremely inspiring and informational. The artists, our coworkers, and even random people we would meet on the
        street seemed to share the belief that street graffiti was not so much an act of rebellion, as an active and
        very effective way or building hope and happiness in the city, especially for a country that is going through
        hard times.</p>

      <p><b>Lucy-</b> &nbsp;On our second day working in the Fablab, and we learned a new technique that neither
        of us had ever
        worked with before - acid printing! We each started with a thin, 3”x3” piece of metal which we etched our
        initial designs into. Next, we added varnish to select areas of our pieces before acid washing them, then
        repeating the process multiple times. My final print was a butterfly with some clouds around. Unlike Julia and
        Jierui, I don’t have a very strong artist background so I was pleasantly surprised at how well my print came
        out.</p>

      </div>
      <p><b>Jierui-</b> &nbsp;At Vila Itororó, we learned about the cultural and historical importance of this center
        and got a tour to see the new community center that was opened there and the ongoing restorations. It was so fun
        to chat with local visitors while trying out all sorts of new fruits from a supermarket close by and planning
        the mural with Grazie. We later visited Civic-co a social entrepreneurship coworking space to explore new ways
        that MISTI Brazil (whose support was essential to this project) could expand partnerships in São Paulo.</p>

      <p><b>Julia-</b> &nbsp;Saturday was our first completely free day to explore! Going to the beach was too risky
        with the fuel strike still ongoing, so we crossed the street to Park Ibirapuera. But a feira livre was set up
        right on our street, so of course we had to first fill our hands with pastels, fruit, and bottles of cashew
        juice before our adventures. The park was humongous, and included a skate park, a museum, a planetarium, and
        more. After, we hiked through a state park to get some good views of the city and see some howler monkeys.</p>

      </div>
      <p><b>Jierui-</b> &nbsp;Sunday morning, we got to explore downtown, stopping at a Liberdade (Japantown) food
        market, an amazing art exhibit on African influence in Brazil, beautiful churches, and a weekly flea market.
        Lucy - That was also our final day in Sao Paulo, so to top it all off we went to the Pride Parade! Apparently,
        it's the largest one around the globe. Going into the crowds of people, the energy was amazing, with rainbows,
        music, and dancing everywhere. It felt like a place where everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, ethnicity,
        or gender, could feel safe and have a great time.

      <p>Borderline was invited to create augmented reality animations for MIT's One Sustainable World Tent Parties to
        highlight the impact of climate change on major world cities. We hope everyone had a wonderful night and came
        away with memorable, new experiences and understanding! Here are some scenes from the parties.</p>

          target="hello"></a>Hello, we're from the internet., Borderline decided create our own
        intervention at the MFA in Boston. And which better place to do it at than the highly social media friendly
        <a href="https://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/takashi-murakami/video/murakami-tsuji-and-the-mfa"
          target="murakami">Takashi Murakami exhibit</a>? Borderline added augmented reality animations to several of
        the artworks there. Check out our animations at the exhibit closing April 1st at the MFA to see for yourself!
      </p>
      <p>We thought the Murakami exhibit was especially fitting for Borderline to animate and augment, with elements of
        animation present within the handscrolls exhibited there and the encouraged social media interaction. </p>

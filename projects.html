        This past semester, only about a quarter of MIT students were invited to return to campus. With many facilities
        closed and classes being taught remotely, Borderline could not paint new AR murals in the tunnels under Building
        66, as we would have done during a normal fall semester. But fear not, we realized that art can be placed
        anywhere-- on the back of your laptop, the outside of your water bottle, the front page of your bullet journal,
        on your face … you name it! The magic solution? Turning art into stickers! This semester, Borderline conducted a
        series of virtual hands-on learning workshops intended to recreate the magic of the Borderline process
        (designing, creating, and animating a mural) despite being fully remote. Through the workshops, participants
        learned the skills and software to design, export, print, and animate their own stickers! Generously funded by
        Council for the Arts at MIT (CAMIT), we were even able to print and ship stickers to 20 lucky raffle winners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first-ever sticker-making workshop attracted the interest of over 70 enthusiastic participants. At the
        event, our Design Co-Chair, Margaret Zheng ‘23, taught and demonstrated the <a

          target="stickerslide"> basics of digital art and sticker design</a> using tools such as Photoshop and
        Procreate. Our
        Animation Co-Chair Audrey Cui '24 went over the process of uploading designs to <a
          href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/mit-borderline/shop" target="redbubbleshop"
          style="color: #ff7360 !important;">RedBubble</a> to be sold on merchandise such as stickers, keychains, and
        water bottles. After more art magic, <a

      <p>"Tunnels connect many of MIT's buildings, and they can even connect a community in quarantine. Inspired by
        Corona Maison, Tunnel66 is a place to gather and showcase the unique cultures of the MIT and adMIT
        communities,
        in lieu of CPW. Each person adds a room to Tunnel66, forming one connected tunnel below."
      </p>

      <p>This is the philosophy behind <a href="http://tunnel.mit.edu/" target="tunnel">Tunnel66</a>, Borderline's
        Spring 2020 project which strives to deliver the magic of the Borderline murals-- a living, breathing
        collaborative work of art where the MIT community can express themselves and share with others-- to wherever
        we
        may be scattered. It's an opportunity to gather and showcase what makes our campus, and our community, so
        special. As an exciting update, Tunnel66 was featured on <a

        Borderline is a club at MIT that started in Spring of 2017 (our freshman spring), when a group
        of upperclassmen got funding from the Council of the Arts at MIT to paint a 200-foot long
        section of the MIT Tunnels under building 66. Then, augmented reality animations were added to
        some of the murals, meaning if you put your phone up to the murals, an animation will play over
        it! That semester, we both got to make our own murals and animations, and since then, we have
        been part of the exec team as co-AR chairs, teaching anyone who wants to learn, how to make
        their own AR animations! Borderline has really expanded past the tunnels through a variety of
        projects, and is now a community of people interested in the intersection of art and technology.
        CPW is something we, as a club, were really looking forward to as a time to showcase to the
        incoming class what Borderline is all about: collaboration and community through art and
        technology! So as part of this years CP*, Borderline has launched a “digital tunnel,” Tunnel66,
        to stay connected!<br><br>psssttt @ 2024 pre-frosh: download the <a
          href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/artivive/id1188737494" target="vive">Artivive</a> app to
        find some secret AR messages on the tunnel66 murals :D :A</p>

      <p><b class="people">Gloria ’21, President:</b><br>
        I remember being interested in Borderline ever since seeing the club’s AR demo at CPW Midway,
        even before I knew I was coming to MIT. Freshman fall, I painted and animated a mural in the
        tunnel. The following spring, I painted another mural in the Banana Lounge and joined Borderline
        exec. I’m now President of the club during one of the weirdest semesters in recent memory. Like
        many other clubs, Borderline was planning and looking forward to events and projects (including
        CPW) this semester– then we got sent home. </p>
      <p>About a month into Corona-tine, our Pub Chair, Sky, suggested that Borderline do a
        collaborative art project to connect the community in isolation, and she shared <a
          href="https://coronamaison.fun/" target="cm">this project</a>.
        Around the same time, we started getting CP(*) planning emails from ASA, and the idea of
        Tunnel66 was born. After some more planning, I wrote up the Tunnel66 site, requested the
        tunnel.mit.edu hostname, and drew the first “room” in a couple days. Since CPW was probably the
        reason I comMITted, I’m excited to contribute to a project that preserves some of that energy
        for this year’s adMITs and encapsulates the magic of Borderline’s murals– a living, breathing
        collaborative work of art where students can express themselves and share with the community.
      </p>

      <p><b class="people">Margaret ’23, Design Co-chair:</b><br>
        When I first saw the Borderline murals in the tunnels on my campus tour as a rising high school
        senior, I didn’t know what it was called, but I knew I just had to come back and walk through
        the tunnels once more after the actual tour had concluded. To me, it radiated colors and
        inspiring energy of so many kinds, in so many aspects; I could only imagine how many more have
        smiled and gazed at those murals, and walked away with thoughts and imaginations. I have wished
        that I could contribute to this massive, collaborative masterpiece all up until I got to paint a
        mural and join Borderline’s exec board in my first semester at MIT, which I’m beyond grateful
        for. </p>
      <p>Since then, working behind the magic of those amazing murals with a team of dedicated
        art-lovers have definitely broadened my understanding of different communities and art styles.
        While unfortunately our original plans for CPW and the semester have been halted, the idea of
        Tunnel66 sounded to me just as inspiring and welcoming as a way to showcase aspects of MIT
        communities – and this time, even prefrosh could join! I drew up a very simple template with a
        ladder that connects each room in the tower, coz although we are all physically apart, we still
        want to be together in spirit! I can’t wait to see this tower built collaboratively by members
        of the MIT community & adMITs and learn more about what everyone else’s been up to!</p>

      <p><b class="people">Jenny ’22, Animation Co-chair:</b><br>
        When I was a junior in high school, my Science Olympiad team came to MIT to participate in the
        invitational that MIT hosts every year. While I was running from event to event, trying to
        figure out where I’m supposed to be next, I accidentally wandered into the basement and got
        outrageously lost, but somehow ended up in the tunnels in building 66. I didn’t even know it was
        AR or animation related, but the murals were stunning. I couldn’t stay for long, but I knew I
        definitely wanted to come back one day and contribute some way or another to the organization
        behind it. Freshman year, I got to take a better look at it and realized the murals were
        animated!! I had never really drawn or painted, but I started learning Blender (a 3D modeling
        program) to try my hand at digital animation. I was able to join Borderline exec my sophomore
        fall, and I’m so grateful for this opportunity to make art more accessible to others, and to
        bring a splash of color and joy to MIT students who often walk through the tunnels to get around
        campus. Tunnel66 is an interactive, community building project that brings together all of
        Borderline’s unique strengths, combining AR, art, and a sense of community to all.</p>

      <p><b class="people">Lucy ’21, Financial Chair:</b><br>
        The week before orientation my freshman fall was the first time I saw the tunnels under building
        66, and the moment I saw the first animation I knew I had to get involved with Borderline.
        Having never been very good at drawing, being an artist always seemed like an unattainable task
        to me, but animation has helped me bridge the gap between art and technology. I’m hoping to
        continue to promote art across MIT’s campus!</p>

      <p>The sounds of students jostling in the Infinite die away upon stepping into the Compton Lounge at room
        26-110.
        Colorful bean bags, a coffee and tea station, and Legos invite the student into the space, flooded with
        natural
        light from the floor-to-ceiling windows. Beyond, groups of students are sitting at tables working or chatting,
        surrounded by bright bunches of yellow bananas. A large alcove around the corner is stocked with pillows and
        blankets for students looking to nap or decompress. The walls are decked with large paintings featuring
        fantastical scenes supported by a backdrop of dreamy cotton candy clouds.
      </p>
      <p>Each original artwork is unique in subject and styles range from realism to pop art to abstract
        expressionism.
        The alcove area artworks cohesively form a gallery of thought-provoking artwork that promotes themes of
        tranquility, reflection, and discovery for students seeking respite from their busy days. The more
        lighthearted
        artworks in the main space are sure to put a smile on students’ faces as they grab a banana and catch up with

      <p>As part of the College of Computing Opening, Borderline helped organize The Mural Augmentation Challenge!
        This
        was an opportunity for MIT students to add their own Augmented Reality animations to the Stata Street murals
        made by ten MIT students in December 2018. As part of the challenge, Borderline held an AR workshop in the
        Stata
        Center to teach students one-on-one how to make their AR animations from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>In parallel to the Mural Augmentation Challenge, a ten foot printed copy of the mural painted in the Suffolk
        County House of Correction was also hung in the Stata Center for the College of Computing Opening. This
        project
        was a collaborative effort between Sara Brown, Senior Lecturer for MTA, MIT students in her IAP class, the ESG
        Prison Initiative, and the female inmates at the prison.</p>
      <p>The winners of the The Mural Augmentation Challenge were: <br>
        1. Heya Lee for the augmentation of Shichao Yue's image titled: A Reflection of Colors.<br><br>
        2. Natasha Hirt for the augmentation of Navid Abedzadeh's image titled: MIT Stata. <br><br>
        3. Wanyi (Sherry) Xiao, Yi Yang, Jacqueline Chen, and Peiling Jiang for the augmentation of the HOC Mural
        project's shared mural from the South Bay House of Corrections and MIT collaboration.

      <p>Over MIT’s Independent Activities Period (IAP) in January 2019, over a dozen MIT students and just as many
        women inmates worked together for three hours a day on a two-story mural in the South Bay House of Correction.
        The project and class were led by Sara Brown, MIT Assistant Professor and Director of Design for MIT Music and
        Theater Arts, and Peggy Rambach, arts teacher at South Bay. A replica of the mural has been displayed on
        campus
        in the MIT List Visual Arts Center.
      </p>
      <p>During the first part of the project participants practiced key painting techniques and reflected on images
        with the greatest symbolism in their own lives, eventually agreeing on a core set of visuals including a
        mother
        lovingly cradling her child, a sunset radiating through an open door, and water droplets descending from an
        eye
        in the sky. After learning and practicing a wide range of painting and composition techniques, participants
        split the two-story mural into nine panels and collaborated to combine them into one cohesive work. Although
        the
        class and project themselves have ended, the parallel murals exhibited at the South Bay House of Correction
        and
        at MIT serve as a reminder that the lessons learned, memories created, and friendships formed will remain
        intact
        for far longer.

        In collaboration with Giovanna Casimiro, Borderline created two augmented murals in Porto Seguro and Vila
        Itororó, two important cultural centers of&nbsp;São Paulo, bridging the spacial gap between the locations
        through the rich graffiti heritage, street textures, and sights of Brazil.&nbsp; We worked with Efêmmera, a
        feminist graffiti organization striving to empower women street artists, staff at the cultural centers, and
        outside independent artists to bring our vision to life.&nbsp; We're so excited to share our experience with
        you, brought back through sights, sounds, and nostalgic recollections! &lt;3

      <p><b>Some Thoughts From Brazil:</b> <br><br>
        <b>Jierui-</b> &nbsp;Arriving in Brazil, I was surprised at how colorful, modern, and geometric all the
        buildings were. I was also surprised to learn that it was winter in São Paulo. Despite the jet lag, I loved
        listening as
        filmmaker Alessandra Emy and graffiti artist V taught about the unique Brazilian pixo style, that originated
        right here in São Paulo.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p><b>Julia-</b> &nbsp;São Paulo definitely has character. Graffiti and public sculptures were everywhere, and
        old buildings
        were squashed between new modern architecture, but even the new buildings had pichacao (tagging) on them. The
        streets were strangely quiet and open because we had arrived in the middle of a fuel strike. Strikers, mainly
        truckers, angry at the increase in gas price, were blocking the roads into the city, preventing gasoline, but
        also inadvertently groceries and other materials, from entering the city. Such a strike has never happened
        before, and everyone was worried, but the city continued to function, and we got to experience a very lively
        metropolitan. </p>
      <div class="images">
        <img width="60%" alt="Julia and Local Artists" src="./images/projects/brazil/brazil2.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>We got to work with a different set of street artists everyday, which was both a logistical nightmare, but
        also
        extremely inspiring and informational. The artists, our coworkers, and even random people we would meet on the
        street seemed to share the belief that street graffiti was not so much an act of rebellion, as an active and
        very effective way or building hope and happiness in the city, especially for a country that is going through
        hard times.</p>

      <p><b>Lucy-</b> &nbsp;On our second day working in the Fablab, and we learned a new technique that neither
        of us had ever
        worked with before - acid printing! We each started with a thin, 3”x3” piece of metal which we etched our
        initial designs into. Next, we added varnish to select areas of our pieces before acid washing them, then
        repeating the process multiple times. My final print was a butterfly with some clouds around. Unlike Julia and
        Jierui, I don’t have a very strong artist background so I was pleasantly surprised at how well my print came
        out.</p>

      <p><b>Jierui-</b> &nbsp;At Vila Itororó, we learned about the cultural and historical importance of this center
        and got a tour to see the new community center that was opened there and the ongoing restorations. It was so
        fun
        to chat with local visitors while trying out all sorts of new fruits from a supermarket close by and planning
        the mural with Grazie. We later visited Civic-co a social entrepreneurship coworking space to explore new ways
        that MISTI Brazil (whose support was essential to this project) could expand partnerships in São Paulo.</p>

      <p><b>Julia-</b> &nbsp;Saturday was our first completely free day to explore! Going to the beach was too risky
        with the fuel strike still ongoing, so we crossed the street to Park Ibirapuera. But a feira livre was set up
        right on our street, so of course we had to first fill our hands with pastels, fruit, and bottles of cashew
        juice before our adventures. The park was humongous, and included a skate park, a museum, a planetarium, and
        more. After, we hiked through a state park to get some good views of the city and see some howler monkeys.</p>

      <p><b>Jierui-</b> &nbsp;Sunday morning, we got to explore downtown, stopping at a Liberdade (Japantown) food
        market, an amazing art exhibit on African influence in Brazil, beautiful churches, and a weekly flea market.
        Lucy - That was also our final day in Sao Paulo, so to top it all off we went to the Pride Parade! Apparently,
        it's the largest one around the globe. Going into the crowds of people, the energy was amazing, with rainbows,
        music, and dancing everywhere. It felt like a place where everyone, regardless of sexual orientation,
        ethnicity,
        or gender, could feel safe and have a great time.

          target="hello"></a>Hello, we're from the internet., Borderline decided create our own
        intervention at the MFA in Boston. And which better place to do it at than the highly social media friendly
        <a href="https://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/takashi-murakami/video/murakami-tsuji-and-the-mfa"
          target="murakami">Takashi Murakami exhibit</a>? Borderline added augmented reality animations to several of
        the artworks there. Check out our animations at the exhibit closing April 1st at the MFA to see for yourself!
      </p>
      <p>We thought the Murakami exhibit was especially fitting for Borderline to animate and augment, with elements
        of
        animation present within the handscrolls exhibited there and the encouraged social media interaction.

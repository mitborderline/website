        Wanyi (Sherry) Xiao, Yi Yang, Peiling Jiang, Jacqueline Chen
      </p>

      <p>As part of the College of Computing Opening, Borderline helped organize The Mural Augmentation Challenge! This
        was an opportunity for MIT students to add their own Augmented Reality animations to the Stata Street murals
        made by ten MIT students in December 2018. As part of the challenge, Borderline held an AR workshop in the Stata
        Center to teach students one-on-one how to make their AR animations from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>In parallel to the Mural Augmentation Challenge, a ten foot printed copy of the mural painted in the Suffolk
        County House of Correction was also hung in the Stata Center for the College of Computing Opening. This project
        was a collaborative effort between Sara Brown, Senior Lecturer for MTA, MIT students in her IAP class, the ESG
        Prison Initiative, and the female inmates at the prison.</p>
      <p>The winners of the The Mural Augmentation Challenge were: <br>
        1. Heya Lee for the augmentation of Shichao Yue's image titled: A Reflection of Colors.<br><br>
        2. Natasha Hirt for the augmentation of Navid Abedzadeh's image titled: MIT Stata. <br><br>
        3. Wanyi (Sherry) Xiao, Yi Yang, Jacqueline Chen, and Peiling Jiang for the augmentation of the HOC Mural project's shared mural from the South Bay House of Corrections and MIT collaboration.

        <b>Muralists:</b> Tiago, Grazie, Lady Guedes, Aline</p>

      <p>In collaboration with Giovanna Casimiro, Borderline created two augmented murals in Porto Seguro and Vila
        Itororó, two important cultural centers of&nbsp;São Paulo, bridging the spacial gap between the locations
        through the rich graffiti heritage, street textures, and sights of Brazil.&nbsp; We worked with Efêmmera, a
        feminist graffiti organization striving to empower women street artists, staff at the cultural centers, and
        outside independent artists to bring our vision to life.&nbsp; We're so excited to share our experience with
        you, brought back through sights, sounds, and nostalgic recollections! &lt;3 </p>

      <p class="italic"><b>Some Thoughts From Brazil:</b></p>
      <p><b>Jierui-</b> &nbsp;Arriving in Brazil, I was surprised at how colorful, modern, and geometric all the
        buildings were.
        I was also surprised to learn that it was winter in São Paulo. Despite the jet lag, I loved listening as
        filmmaker Alessandra Emy and graffiti artist V taught about the unique Brazilian pixo style, that originated
        right here in São Paulo.</p>
      <div class="images">
        <p><img width="30%" alt="São Paulo" src="./images/projects/brazil/brazil1.jpg">
          <img width="30%" alt="São Paulo" src="./images/projects/brazil/brazil11.jpg"></p>
      </div>
      <p><b>Julia-</b> &nbsp;São Paulo definitely has character. Graffiti and public sculptures were everywhere, and
        old buildings
        were squashed between new modern architecture, but even the new buildings had pichacao (tagging) on them. The
        streets were strangely quiet and open because we had arrived in the middle of a fuel strike. Strikers, mainly
        truckers, angry at the increase in gas price, were blocking the roads into the city, preventing gasoline, but
        also inadvertently groceries and other materials, from entering the city. Such a strike has never happened
        before, and everyone was worried, but the city continued to function, and we got to experience a very lively
        metropolitan. </p>
      <div class="images">
        <p><img width="60%" alt="Julia and Local Artists" src="./images/projects/brazil/brazil2.jpg"></p>
      </div>
      <p>We got to work with a different set of street artists everyday, which was both a logistical nightmare, but also
        extremely inspiring and informational. The artists, our coworkers, and even random people we would meet on the
        street seemed to share the belief that street graffiti was not so much an act of rebellion, as an active and
        very effective way or building hope and happiness in the city, especially for a country that is going through
        hard times.</p>

      <p><b>Lucy-</b> &nbsp;On our second day working in the Fablab, and we learned a new technique that neither
        of us had ever
        worked with before - acid printing! We each started with a thin, 3”x3” piece of metal which we etched our
        initial designs into. Next, we added varnish to select areas of our pieces before acid washing them, then
        repeating the process multiple times. My final print was a butterfly with some clouds around. Unlike Julia and
        Jierui, I don’t have a very strong artist background so I was pleasantly surprised at how well my print came
        out.</p>

      </div>
      <p><b>Jierui-</b> &nbsp;At Vila Itororó, we learned about the cultural and historical importance of this center
        and got a tour to see the new community center that was opened there and the ongoing restorations. It was so fun
        to chat with local visitors while trying out all sorts of new fruits from a supermarket close by and planning
        the mural with Grazie. We later visited Civic-co a social entrepreneurship coworking space to explore new ways
        that MISTI Brazil (whose support was essential to this project) could expand partnerships in São Paulo.</p>

      <p><b>Julia-</b> &nbsp;Saturday was our first completely free day to explore! Going to the beach was too risky
        with the fuel strike still ongoing, so we crossed the street to Park Ibirapuera. But a feira livre was set up
        right on our street, so of course we had to first fill our hands with pastels, fruit, and bottles of cashew
        juice before our adventures. The park was humongous, and included a skate park, a museum, a planetarium, and
        more. After, we hiked through a state park to get some good views of the city and see some howler monkeys.</p>

          <img width="20%" alt="Downtown" src="./images/projects/brazil/brazil66.jpg"></p>
      </div>
      <p><b>Jierui-</b> &nbsp;Sunday morning, we got to explore downtown, stopping at a Liberdade (Japantown) food
        market, an amazing art exhibit on African influence in Brazil, beautiful churches, and a weekly flea market.
        Lucy - That was also our final day in Sao Paulo, so to top it all off we went to the Pride Parade! Apparently,
        it's the largest one around the globe. Going into the crowds of people, the energy was amazing, with rainbows,
        music, and dancing everywhere. It felt like a place where everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, ethnicity,
        or gender, could feel safe and have a great time.

          target="hello"></a>Hello, we're from the internet., Borderline decided create our own
        intervention at the MFA in Boston. And which better place to do it at than the highly social media friendly
        <a href="https://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/takashi-murakami/video/murakami-tsuji-and-the-mfa"
          target="murakami">Takashi Murakami exhibit</a>? Borderline added augmented reality animations to several of
        the artworks there. Check out our animations at the exhibit closing April 1st at the MFA to see for yourself!
      </p>
      <p>We thought the Murakami exhibit was especially fitting for Borderline to animate and augment, with elements of
        animation present within the handscrolls exhibited there and the encouraged social media interaction. </p>

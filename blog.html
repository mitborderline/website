      <h5>AR Marriage Proposal <br><span class="date">2019-09-20</span></h5>
      <br>

        <p style="font-style: italic;">Mural "Abyss or Bliss" by Danny Gelman
          <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJCvF0yqHRM" target="turtle">Click here to view full
            animation</a></p>
      </div>
      <p>
        On January 8th, 2019, one of the Borderline exec members, Danny, received an email from Stephen Cadigan, a
        Cambridge local, asking if Danny could help him propose to his partner with Danny's AR Animation for Borderline.
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; color:#ff7360;">
        “My partner and I had our first "date" in the MIT tunnels (I put date in quotes because I am awkward and he
        didn't know that I was asking him out on a date, but ultimately we ended up kissing in the Asgard.) He
        absolutely loves turtles, and I am currently working on designing a turtle-shaped engagement ring.
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; color:#ff7360;">
        As you have painted a beautiful augmented reality mural with a turtle swimming across, I was wondering if it
        would be possible to temporarily include a message that says "will you marry me" when you look at it through the
        app, sometime this year (preferably in the summer or fall).”
      </p>
      <p>
        Danny and Borderline were very touched by this story, and we were honored to have the chance to be a part of
        their engagement. Danny responded shortly after and we began planning for the proposal! It involved a bit of
        emailing back and forth to figure out logistics and we agreed to meet up in person to discuss the style and
        design choices for the animation. We met in April 2019, where Stephen revealed that he is also a designer, and
        had designed an adorable font made to look like bubbles, to fit with the ocean theme. We also discussed the plan
        to have the animation ready by the end of summer, test it in the fall, and on the day of the proposal switch the
        normal turtle AR animation for the proposal AR animation, to avoid any chances of the surprise getting leaked.
        After that meeting, he sent Danny an illustrator file with the “Will you marry me, Jack?” message drawn out in
        his bubble font. At that point, Danny edited his turtle animation to include that animated message, making the
        letters bob up and down gently as they trail behind the turtle. The collaboration to create the animation went
        really smoothly, and it was really fun, too!
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the summer, we continued to stay in touch over email as Stephen solidified the date of the proposal. When
        Danny got back to campus for the fall semester, he tested the proposal AR animation on-site, and everything was
        pretty much ready. The date of the proposal was set for September 20th, 2019, so all that was left to do was
        switch the animation over to the proposal version.
        <br><br>
        In the end, the proposal was a success!

      <br>
      <p class="italic"><b>Note:</b> The post below describes Borderline's original (proprietary) AR app. Since then,
        Borderline has switched to the app Artivive for AR, and we are currently developing a new proprietary AR app.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks to the incredible efforts of Avery Lamp '20 and Jessie Wang '19, Borderline has both an iOS and Android
        app!
      </p>
      <p>To use the app, go to the tunnels and look for the mural with the matching icon. Select the icon and hold your
        phone up to the mural so that your you can see most of the mural on your screen through the camera. Enjoy!

      <p>Coordinating fifty people filled with undirected enthusiasm for your project turns out to be pretty tricky.

        Props to everyone for turning around mural submissions within a week. We’ll be having some fantastic murals
        painted.

        Lots of murals means a Home Depot run to buy a lot of paint! We also needed some way to hold all our buckets of
        paint, buckets of paint stirrers, buckets of buckets, etc. <br>Here’s a picture of fearless leader Julia Rue

        3’x3′ box, with generous application of the staple gun. </p>

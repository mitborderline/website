      </div>
      <p>Scale and community impact drew Dipo to mural painting. Finding beauty in spatial geometry, nature, mathematics
        and machines, Dipo channeled these influences into his art. He finds art important and special in its ability to
        critique society through a cultural lens and provide the artist with the freedom of expression, and the
        potential to be a synthesizer of many disciplines.
      <p>

      <p>In his piece for the Banana lounge, Dipo was inspired by “the energy and interactions with students in the
        lounge, the geometry of bananas, and push and pull of various available colors.” As he simply remarked, “It was
        an organic approach.”

        <p class="italic">Mural by Anqi Li '23. Post by Margaret Zheng.</p>
      </div>
      <p>An incredibly talented artist from Singapore, Anqi believes that "the power of art lies in how the
        amalgamation of strokes in an artwork has this remarkable way to touch us indelibly and make us feel whole
        again... it is an intangible, visual reflection of the human condition," an idea that many of her artworks
        embrace. Anqi finds inspiration everywhere, from conversations with her peers to graffiti to gallery visits
        as well as her most prized possession: a "really, really (and by that I mean really) thick book of
        illustrations that my art teacher gifted me before I left for college." Although the book "took up so much
        luggage
        space," she would still like to "think it was worth all that trouble lugging it halfway across the globe." </p>
      <p>Around Valentine’s Day of 2019, Anqi was given an opportunity to hold a solo art exhibition in Singapore. After
        visiting many local exhibitions, she wished to bring a special light to the community with her art and let her
        exhibition
        be a "reminder of the hope that can carry us through these trying times." Among her results was an acrylic
        painting of crushed cans. "I had a lot - probably too much - fun with that piece. In the haze of my sugar rush
        from drinking way too many cans of soft drink, I smashed them with a hammer. It was an oddly therapeutic
        process, for sure." </p>
      <p>Although "crushed" objects may often suggest an underlying mood of disappointment, Anqi managed to make her
        painting of crushed cans joyous with splashes of colors in the background, by which she had "hoped to convey a
        feeling of jest and liveliness in my painting of the crushed cans."</p>
      <p>"Something felt missing in the painting though - there seemed to be capacity to extend the metaphor so that the
        meaning behind the painting would be more explicit." Finally, Anqi found her breakthrough after a conversation
        with an artist who visited her exhibition. "We talked about highlighting this idea of 'crushed' in the painting,
        by introducing some darker tones to contrast with the vibrant colors of the cans - adding more shadows perhaps,
        or something else. I made several quick sketches after my conversation with him and chanced upon the idea of
        creating a tower of crushed cans that will cast a shadow of a pensive, dejected person. I wanted this person to
        eventually morph into being triumphant, but I didn’t really know how to incorporate that into my static piece."
      </p>
      <p>"Borderline and the concept of animating murals was the last piece of this puzzle. I haven’t gotten around to
        animating my mural yet, but the concept is to transform the shadow of the man into someone triumphant; a same
        object can cast multiple shadows of different shapes, just like how there are many different outlooks we can
        have on life. I think part of the reason why I enjoy art is kind of reflected in my journey of conceptualizing
        and painting this mural. As my art teacher loved to say, there is never a completed artwork. I really enjoy this
        process of gathering ideas and inspirations from all around and weaving them into a story."</p>

        <p class="italic">Mural by Margaret Zheng '23. Post by Gloria Lin.</p>
      </div>

      <p>"[Emojis] are a more efficient way to express [feelings] than words because a simple face or symbol could
        represent different layers of emotions and messages ... I wonder, what would be the first thought that comes to
        different individuals' minds when they come across a somewhat ambiguous picture containing emojis?" This inquiry
        inspired Margaret's intentionally ambiguous mural, Emoji Hourglass. To the artist herself, the piece "implies
        that the passage of time can transform objects with no emotions into those that are full of vibrant emotions and
        memories."
      </p>

      <p>"Somewhat to my surprise, though, everyone I asked has given me an entirely different answer when I asked for
        their first impression of this painting. Some said 'this is literally my mood at MIT,' some said 'time can
        determine and constrain who we are,' and one person even said the emotionless 'emojis' reminded him of the
        coolness of orange juice. Learning from those incredibly diverse and interesting perspectives has opened my eyes
        to so many ideas that I wouldn't even have thought of, and that to me is the most special part of this mural."
      </p>

      <p>For Margaret, art is both a platform to connect individuals and a means for introspection. She draws
        inspiration "not just from reference pictures, but from deep inside [herself]." Margaret's art is a realization
        onto canvas of the world around her, portraying unique perspectives, feelings, and life events. Margaret enjoys
        giving out artwork as personalized gifts to friends and loved ones, as she is "beyond happy" to make their days
        a little brighter. Margaret also likes to share her artwork via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marge_z_art/"
          target="insta">Instagram</a> and her <a href="https://www.margezart.com/" target="marge">personal website</a>,
        with the hope to "spread positivity to even more individuals in my communities and around the globe."
      </p>

      <p>Margaret adds, "Especially during times of unprecedented crisis, fine arts of all forms could bring
        the world a little more empathy and reinstate a little more hope." Her <a href="https://youtu.be/J8loZfC6olQ"
          target="lockdown">original animation and composition</a> for
        the poem Lockdown is a beautiful example of this. </p>

      </div>
      <p>"Even through all the technological and cultural advances of the ages, nature has always been beautiful to the
        human eye." In her mural Succulent Mineral, Jocelin explores the connection between "two differing parts of
        nature-- the organic and inorganic-- in a fun and unexpected way." She explains, "It was cool to imagine a
        succulent growing straight out of the crystals of a geode, as if life could pop out of nothing but cold hard
        rock. I hope this image also serves as a reminder of how precious the natural world is, and how important it is
        to sustain it."</p>
      <p>Jocelin enjoys art as a way to bring an idea to fruition, create something beautiful, and add a pop of
        brightness to the world with just some colors and strokes. According to Jocelin, "art is fascinating because it
        can be so many things. A pure expression of beauty, or a way to tell a story, or an abstract exploration of
        ideas. Sometimes I find myself staring at a piece and not wanting to tear my eyes away, because it is so
        exquisite or interesting. Art offers an avenue to look at things in a different perspective, and that is
        especially important in today's world." She is inspired by nature, good character designs and portraits, and
        Impressionists like Monet and Matisse.</p>

      </div>
      <p>KoiQueen’s name came out of a moment of coincidence. As a title that once represented one Gloria’s vertices in
        her 6.006 pset, it soon became the title of her work that resides in the Banana Lounge. A fitting place that
        straddles the line between relaxation and problem sets for a piece whose name does the same.
      <p>

      <p>According to Gloria, she was “inspired by the calm feeling that washes over students in the Banana Lounge nap
        area, a place where we can pause to take a breath, momentarily forgetting about psets and deadlines.”
      <p>

      <p>Gloria enjoys art because it's an outlet to express thoughts and feelings and escape the daily stresses of
        life. She remarked, “It's really liberating and satisfying to be able to create anything you can imagine.”

      <p>Having grown up around NYC, Ester developed a deep appreciation of mural art and public art. She likes walking
        around the city to mural hunt and see how the landscape is changing every day. Open up the Artivive App on your
        mobile and point the camera at Ester's picture below to hear her speak about why she finds art important!</p>
      <p>She has also been very involved in sharing her love of public art through CITYarts, a program whose mission is
        to "engage youth with professional artists in the creation of public art, including murals and mosaic. Through
        this creative process, CITYarts empowers, educates, and connects youth and children locally and around the world
        to become active participants in realizing their potential and transforming communities."</p>
      <p>Now she's leaving her mark on the walls of MIT. The idea for her mural, "That Way," was originally inspired by
        a recent trip to France, where she kept getting lost and kept asking strangers for directions. Ester thought
        that since people seem to have a similar experience in the tunnels, this piece would be perfect here! She also
        liked incorporating the big red button in her mural. Who knows what it does?
      <br><br>Fun Fact: As Ester was painting one day, Amelia, an MIT aeroastro student, happened to walk by and ended up
        painting one of the hands!</p>

        engulfing the dandelion seeds or lighting them on fire!</p>
      <p>Isa's art is very inspired by nature. She likes drawing outside, looking at birds and animals, and working to
        upbeat music. Art is a way for her to relax and it's a way of expression for her.
        She wants to encourage everyone to come down to the tunnels to see the paintings for themselves because all the
        murals show something about the people that made it. That's the magic of art.

      <p>Elaine has been doing art since she was 5 years old. You can really tell she has a passion for it by the way
        she talks about it. Elaine enjoys art because when she's just painting, nothing else matters. It's just her, and
        the painting. She likes to work for long periods of time, where she forgets the rest of the world and gets
        absorbed in her work. Art is Elaine's outlet for stress relief, so it's an integral part of her routine. She
        thinks art is important because it has the power to make people feel things. You can make people feel better,
        and feel a wide range of emotions in general.</p>
      <p>For this mural, Elaine wanted to paint doves and study them in an attempt to understand her irrational fear of
        birds. She loves what birds symbolize afterall- freedom and weightlessness.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Last summer, Valentino visited Komodo National Park in his home country, Indonesia, and was intrigued when
        looking at Komodo Dragons (the largest living lizards in the world by the way!).
        Valentino was immediately inspired to make art about these giant reptiles and started sketching out ideas the
        month before Borderline applications were sent out. Valentino has been at MIT since the project's beginning, and
        wanted to get involved before he graduated.</p>
      <p>Valentino didn't want to make the mural realistic and instead chose to use a Batik style. Batik is an old
        Indonesian fabric dyeing technique that's more commonly referred to nowadays as patterns like those that appear
        in "Komodo Dragon" and Valentino's own shirt (pictured below). He also incorporated Indonesia's national motto,
        Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity), into the mural. The result is a piece that's rich with many aspects
        of Indonesian culture and art.</p>
      <p>Valentino has had no formal background in art, and has just recently picked it up through youtube tutorials.
        We're really excited to see his work in the tunnels now!
      <br><br>Valentino would like to thank his helper Luz Gomez for helping him work with the limited space between the
        railings and with painting!</p>

        She wanted to paint this mural as a way to continue practicing art, as she has done a lot of traditional art in
        high school. She plans to take art-related classes at MIT.</p>
      <p>She had two sources of inspiration for this piece. The first is the already completed murals in the Tunnels

        the two. Art can sometimes be organic, but often times can be technical, rational, and analytical. Jude is
        also interested in "cross-sections, especially with unexpected insides," which is what drew her to designing,
        painting, and animating "Split." She is inspired by the work of Rebecca Mock, Jasmin Lai, Noelle Stevenson, and editorial illustrators.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Coming from thirty generations of Italian artists, Maya Levy is no stranger to art. Maya relates that when she
        was only three years old, her grandmother sat her down in front of a bowl of fruit and said, "draw."
        For Find your Adventure in the Borderline tunnel, Maya wanted to leave a mark on MIT and bring a piece of her
        hometown, Aventura. A small section of Miami, Aventura's symbol is a sailboat, as Maya depicted in her mural.
      </p>
      <p>From making a timelapse video of painting a mural for her college applications, to painting sets for campus
        group performances such as the Hamlet production, Maya has quite a bit of mural painting experience under her
        belt. She particularly enjoys public art, as more people can see it and it makes a greater impact.</p>
      <p>Maya finds inspiration in Made You Look, a YouTube makeup artist that does body art. She believes art is
        incredibly important at MIT as it provides a relief from stress. She hopes that Borderline will have the
        opportunity to expand all over campus!</p>

      <p>On cold, windy Boston days, MIT tunnels often provide respite for students wishing to travel between buildings
        without going outdoors. For passersby with attentive eyes, six adorable cacti wait to be discovered throughout
        the Borderline tunnel, offering free hugs and encouragement.</p>
      <p>Painted by Arizona native Fiona Zhang, the cacti vary in form, expression, and style. Many of the cacti are
        incorporated creatively into the styles of other Borderline murals, such as Marwa's Bouken and Helen's Stop and
        Smell the Roses. For these cacti, Fiona was inspired by her home state, Arizona. "Nothing warms me up more than
        a piece of home giving me some encouragement," she said.</p>
      <p>Art is an outlet and a welcome break from "thinking about math all day" for Fiona. "Nothing is better than
        watching my work come to life. The ability to create something beautiful out of raw materials is fascinating."
        She describes her creative process as "done on the spot." "99% of the time I have no idea what I am going to
        create before I do it," she said.</p>

        Khanh's art making process is very bold and daring, as she doesn't sketch anything out beforehand. Instead she

      <p class="italic">"L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux." -Fox from The Little Prince</p>
      <p>Jessica really likes The Little Prince, a popular French children's book by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. In the
        book, Fox imparts some wisdom to the Little Prince: "Here is my secret...It is only with the heart that one can
        see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye." The words in her mural, beautifully written, is the
        last part of the quote written in French.</p>
      <p>Jessica strives to make art that gets people thinking about an idea or a concept in a new and interesting way.
        In this case, that's this beautiful quote that points to the importance of empathy and the heart. Jessica also
        made an animation for her mural which highlights the story elements from The Little Prince, including a blooming
        rose, glowing words, and orbiting asteroid.</p>
      <p>Whenever Jessica finds something interesting, she'll bookmark it for inspiration. One of her favorite artists
        is David Caspar Friedrich, whose atmospheric artwork inspires her.</p>
      <p>She also really loves how art can act as a bridge. In particular, she is very interested in the connection
        between humans, art, and technology, which she explored in AP Studio Art 2D Design and now through getting
        involved in Borderline. Also, kudos to Jessica for painting her mural while being on crutches.</p>

      <p>As many artists discover their passion, Patricia discovered her love for art by doodling over exams and
        homework. Patricia really likes that art can have many different meanings. People can get inspired or moved by a
        piece of work in a completely different way than Patricia intended and that's really cool.</p>
      <p>Patricia's inspiration for her work is music, Van Gogh, and Picasso. Her piece draws from songs she listens to.
        She makes her work very visually busy, just as Van Gogh, so no one gets bored while looking at it. And she
        strives to make people contemplate and maybe even be confused over her work, just as people usually get over
        Picasso's abstract work. Her piece, "Musicians 3," is definitely all of those things, but also uniquely
        something entirely new and different.</p>
      <p>Fun fact: Patricia also took part in painting a similar mural at her high school in Provo, Utah (pictured
        below), so now it's connected to MIT!</p>

      <p>Helen has never painted before. Which blows. My. Mind. She has only worked with pens, pencil, and digital art

        drawn a lot of people and faces.</p>
      <p>She wants people walking past to feel relaxed, and not feel bad about pausing to chill every once in a while.
        Helen found stress-relief in art, and kept it as a self-taught side hobby. She knew the minute she formalized
        things - took lessons, or entered competitions, etc. - art would lose its de-stressing abilities. She hopes
        others can find their own ways to destress.</p>
      <p>The bright yellow on the soft blues were actually picked based on what paints were already poured out and

        This is Jasmine's first time painting in this style. Typically, she likes to paint plant life - for the tunnels,
        however, she wanted to create something striking that would make passer-byers pause. She hasn't had any formal
        art training, but perhaps that's made her more creative on how she gets her paint down, using both paintbrushes
        and her fingers. When she's not painting, Jasmine likes to play rugby! She's joined the team at MIT and plays lock.</p>

      <p>Jierui is jamming out to Chinese love songs on Spotify when I find her in the tunnels. She's in her natural
        habitat, with an in-progress painting in front of her.</p>
      <p>When she was a kid, she always wanted to paint her room. Her parents always said no. After much pestering, her
        parents finally promised her that she'd get to paint her new room after they finished moving. When they finally
        got settled in, however, all her parents got her was a quart sized can of orange that wouldn't even cover a full
        wall. Jierui still doesn't have painted walls.
        On this flipside, this is her chance to live out her dream! She'd never used latex paint before, so she started
        with a simple pattern of cells. They're colored orange and blue: her favorite color and a common color cells are
        drawn as. The cells curve in a way reminiscent of the power lines she saw driving down Texas highways. Near
        evening, you would see thousands of birds sitting along the lines, who would then rise and fly away in a <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4f_1_r80RY" target="murmur">murmuration</a>. The two birds in her mural
        are flapping through the film of cells and breaking free. Jierui wants everyone to feel similarly happy and
        free. <br><br>Special thanks to Xialou G. and Pearl L.</p>

      <P>Julia says that when she thinks of the word 'mural', she immediately thinks of street art, simple and quickly

        slow to paint.</P>

      <p>Nautilus facts:<br>
        - They swim backwards because they haven't evolved in, like, a million years.<br>
        - They swim by inhaling water and spitting it back out.<br>
        - When the inhale water, they add the salt from the water into their bloodstream. This gives them the requisite
        Na+ to allow their muscles to fire.<br>
        - The plural of nautilus is unknown to both Jessie and the author.</p>
      <p>One of Jessie's favorite muralists is <a href="https://www.etamcru.com/" target="cru">Etam Cru</a>, a duo of
        artists from Poland.
        They have <a href="https://www.etamcru.com/etam/och-teatr" target="cru">cool murals all over</a>. One of their
        murals is of a <a href="https://www.etamcru.com/etam/madamme-chicken" target="cru">chicken</a>.
        It served as Jessie's main inspiration for her mural.</p>
      <p>Once she saw a video of one of them painting a mural - he didn't sketch anything out on the wall, he just held
        his pencil sketch in one hand and a roller in the other. #goals</p>
      <p>Jessie's process is a bit more intensive (and still just as magical). When I went to visit her while she was
        painting, I saw pictures taped up all around the edges. The central chicken in the pot is photo referenced,
        meaning at some point there was a chicken, probably sad, most definitely confused, floating in a pot in a body
        of water, quietly wondering how it had gotten in such a predicament. She also had a couple of digital sketches
        printed out. It was colored on Photoshop, but then underwent some filtering on Instagram until she found what
        she liked. #moderntechnology</p>
      <p>The final result is a potpourri of items that don't have a clear connection, but something about the
        deliberateness of their combined oddity makes it feel like it should mean something.</p>
      <p>I've had the joy and pleasure of working with Jessie on some other art projects, and I can say this mural stays
        true to her style. It has very confident strokes, and her signature mix of very cute and quite derpy in the
        subject matter. Her favorite part of the mural: "The nautilus eye came out real dank. It looks like it's staring at you."</p>
